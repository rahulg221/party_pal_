# Party Pal
A BAC-tracker that promotes safer drinking habits.

## Purpose
For college students, a grave issue in today's age is binge drinking. Many students find themselves regularly hung over, puking, or blacking out due to a lack of self control or drinking experience. This app was designed to help alleviate that problem by providing several quick and easy to use features that help the user track and control their drinking. 

## Features
- Color-coded ring recommendation system
  
  As the user inputs drinks, a color-changing ring will show them the percentage of their set limit they have consumed. The ring will display as green when the user can take more drinks, yellow as the user approaches their limit, and red if the user surpasses the limit. The limit is based upon their recommendation setting, tolerance scale, and personal stats. The ring percentage and color will also adjust as time passes, allowing the user to always have an idea of where they are limit-wise at any given time. The user is also able to view their # of standard drinks at any time. 

- Occasion-based Recommendation Settings

  
  The user has the option to select from three settings: Light, Moderate, Heavy; all for different drinking occasions. The light mode will stop the user before their pass the legal driving limit, the Moderate mode will be used for most occasions, and the Heavy mode will stop the user before they enter levels where they may puke or black out.

- Tolerance Scale
  
  As the user uses the app, they may find it is not necessarily accurate for them because everyone processes alcohol differently. To alleviate this, they can now adjust their own tolerance scale to adjust the recommendation setting to their own needs. The tolerance scale will allow for a 1-20% increase or decrease in their limit setting, and the user is responsible for adjusting this as they see fit. 
  
- BAC calculation
  
  Uses a modified version of the Widmark's algorithm to calculate the user's BAC based on gender, weight, and time elapsed. The user can view their current estimated BAC at any time.

- Driving Alert
  
  Provides a real-time timer countdownt to let the user know when their BAC level will fall below the indicated legal driving limit. The timer is intentioned to only be an estimate, and the user is urged to always use their own judgment when deciding to drive.

- One-hand optimized drink selection
  
  Allows the user to quickly input drinks in a matter of seconds with one hand use. This is important as this app would likely be used in a party environment, where ease of use is a crucial factor in deciding whether or not a user would use the app or skip out on it completely.

- Drink History
  
  Displays all of the drinks that the user has had that night with drink type, size, alcohol percentage, and time the user drank it at. 
    
- BAC information
  
  Displays various forms of BAC-related information for the user to better understand the impacts and become more knowledgeable about drinking. The more the user understands about BAC and its consequences, the safer they are.
